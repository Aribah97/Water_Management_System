# Water_Management_System
A project for managing water distribution among consumers.

**GIT**

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects by managing revisions and merging changes seamlessly. Git operates locally, enabling offline work, and integrates with remote repositories like GitHub for centralized collaboration. Its features include branching, tagging, and efficient handling of large projects.

**Commands used** 

git status

git add .

git commit -m

git push

git clone

git checkout

git switch

git branch

git branch -r

**UML**

UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are visual representations used in software engineering to illustrate system structures, behaviors, and interactions. They provide a standardized way to communicate complex systems, processes, and architectures among stakeholders. UML diagrams include various types such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and use case diagrams, each serving different purposes. These diagrams aid in understanding, designing, documenting, and analyzing software systems, facilitating clearer communication and effective development processes.

There are several types of UML diagrams, each serving a specific purpose in software development and system modeling. Here are some common types:

**[Class Diagrams](https://github.com/Aribah97/Water_Management_System/blob/main/UML_Diagrams/UML_Class_Diagram.pdf)**: Represent the static structure of a system by showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships between classes.

**[Sequence Diagrams](https://github.com/Aribah97/Water_Management_System/blob/main/UML_Diagrams/UML_Sequence_Diagram.pdf)**: Illustrate the interactions between objects or components in a system over time, focusing on the order of messages exchanged.

**[Use Case Diagrams](https://github.com/Aribah97/Water_Management_System/blob/main/UML_Diagrams/UML_Use_Case_Diagram.pdf)**: Depict the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a system to describe its functionality from a user's perspective.

**[Activity Diagrams](https://github.com/Aribah97/Water_Management_System/blob/main/UML_Diagrams/UML_Activity_Diagram.pdf)**: Visualize the flow of control or workflow within a system, detailing the steps or actions involved in a process.

**Clean Code Development**

**[Clean code development](https://github.com/Aribah97/Water_Management_System/blob/main/Clean%20Code%20Development.pdf)** involves writing code that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. This approach emphasizes the importance of readability, simplicity, and clarity in code, enabling developers to collaborate effectively and produce high-quality software. Key principles include using meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes, breaking down code into small, cohesive modules, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and following consistent formatting and commenting practices. By adhering to these principles, developers can create code that is easy to read, test, and refactor, leading to improved productivity, reduced bugs, and enhanced maintainability throughout the software development lifecycle.

**IDE**
I have used Arduino IDE because I had to proogram the controller to detect and provide the signals from actuator it uses c++ language I like it because it has alot of libraries, its free to use and you can acheive alot form it.
